    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Recipe yields 3 servings</p>
    <h3>Sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 Â½ tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili-garlic sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Noodles:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped peanuts</li>
        <li>2 medium green onions, thinly sliced diagonally</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar,
            chili garlic sauce, and ginger together in a small bowl.
            Add peanut butter, whisking until well combined,
            and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a pot.
            Discard the flavor packet and add ramen noodles 
            to the boiling water. Cook until noodles are tender, 
            4 to 5 minutes. Drain noodles, reserving some of 
            the noodle water in case you need to thin out the sauce later.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour sauce over ramen noodles, tossing until well coated.
            If sauce is too thick, thin out with a small amount
            of the reserved noodle water until you reach 
            your desired consistency. Your hot noodles will soak up 
            the sauce. Garnish with peanuts and green onion, and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
